# Coastin'

In the cannabis industry, very few if any organizations or individuals give back to the Free and Open Source Software community. The industry is extremely isolationist, keeping as much private as possible; and for good reason.

But `Left Coast Collective` navigates the obsticles involved, and gives back to the many communities it has benefited from itself. This isn't just in code, but also in jobs, contracts, sponsorships, equity and revenue sharing, etc.
